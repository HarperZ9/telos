/**
 * fuse.mjs - balanced multi-channel feature fusion.
 *
 * Naive concatenation of channels with very different dimensionalities or
 * magnitudes lets the high-dimensional / high-variance channel dominate
 * Euclidean distance, drowning discriminative signal from smaller channels
 * (E8 finding: 192-dim noisy visual channel killed 16-dim perfect sound channel,
 * V_combined=27.8% < V_sound=100%).
 *
 * Two sources of dominance:
 *   1. Magnitude: a high-magnitude channel shifts distances more per dimension.
 *      Fix: z-normalize each channel independently (mean=0, std=1 within channel).
 *   2. Dimensionality: a 192-dim channel contributes ~√(192/16) ≈ 3.5× more total
 *      L2 mass than a 16-dim channel even after per-dimension z-norm, because
 *      L2 ∝ √(n_dims · per_dim_variance).
 *      Fix: scale each channel's normalized vector by 1/√(dim) so every channel
 *      contributes equal expected L2 mass regardless of dimension count.
 *
 * Default weighting: 'equalmass' - each channel scaled by 1/sqrt(features.length).
 * Override with opts.weights for explicit per-channel control.
 *
 * Deterministic, pure, zero-dep.
