## Verdicts

| Claim | Status | Disposition | Margin | Method | Grounds |
| --- | --- | --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| The Navier-Stokes periodic skew-symmetry packet has a reference kernel receipt whose deterministic finite-mode nonlinear energy-transfer probe reports MATCH within declared tolerances. | MATCH | fenced | 1 | reference-kernel-skew-symmetry-receipt-review | deviation 0 within tolerance 0.5 |
| The Navier-Stokes periodic skew-symmetry packet explicitly keeps the parent Navier-Stokes Millennium problem UNVERIFIABLE. | MATCH | fenced | 1 | grand-claim-boundary-review | deviation 0 within tolerance 0.5 |
| The packet includes negative boundaries that block promoting a finite-mode skew-symmetry witness into a global regularity theorem, physical-fluid validation, or new law-of-physics claim. | MATCH | fenced | 1 | negative-boundary-review | deviation 0 within tolerance 0.5 |
