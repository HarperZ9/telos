# BuildLang Native Optimization Kernel Brief

Date: 2026-07-01

## Result

Pass 0095 runs the 12-item knapsack exact enumeration directly in BuildLang.
The program emits best value 162, best weight
29, best mask 2347, and feasible count
1275. The source also has a verified `buildc` receipt.

## Product Meaning

This moves the optimization megatool from external Python-only replay toward a
language/runtime receipt. The next step is either a BuildLang branch-comparison
kernel or an OR-Tools install/dependency receipt for market comparability.
