# SAIR Stage 1 Judge Repository Adapter Brief

Date: 2026-07-02

## Decision

Promote the SAIR lane from synthetic fixture to public repository adapter.
The repo gives us a compact competition proof-packet surface: prompt template,
problem JSONL, pinned model config, model-call boundary, verdict extractor, and
test suite.

## Product Implication

This becomes the first `CompetitionProofPacket` adapter class: a source-pinned
public judge repo can be wrapped by Gather source refs, Index context, Forum
routing, Crucible claims, Telos action receipts, and future BuildLang exact
reasoning branches.

## Next Push

Add a hosted-model attempt receipt that records provider route, prompt hash,
problem ids, response hash, parser verdict, cost/tokens, and action admission
without exporting the API key or hidden reasoning. Then attach a Stage 2 Lean
certificate branch.

Repo head: `fe00cf9e9080dba6634882c9316b73d536c4fe60`.
