## Verdicts

| Claim | Status | Disposition | Margin | Method | Grounds |
| --- | --- | --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| The wind-down synthesis and master plan documents exist and are linked from README.md. | MATCH | fenced | 1 | file-and-readme-review | deviation 0 within tolerance 0.5 |
| The research corpus inventory records at least 150 pass ledgers, 163 packets, 445 schema artifacts, 147 Crucible run records, and 26 Gather source stores. | MATCH | fenced | 1 | filesystem-inventory | deviation 0 within tolerance 0.5 |
| Pass 0151 records the final frontier-problem source federation with 83 candidate sources, 24 Gather-verified captures, 12 problem lanes, and 8 admission gates. | MATCH | fenced | 1 | artifact-review | deviation 0 within tolerance 0.5 |
| The master plan covers Gather, Index, Forum, Crucible, Telos, Learn, BuildLang/buildc, and Emet as named pillars. | MATCH | fenced | 1 | document-review | deviation 0 within tolerance 0.5 |
| The wind-down deliverables preserve boundaries: they do not claim current proof of new laws of physics, clinical efficacy, or raw-scale frontier model superiority. | MATCH | fenced | 1 | boundary-review | deviation 0 within tolerance 0.5 |
| The run corpus manifest records 150 pass-ledger rows through pass 0151. | MATCH | fenced | 1 | manifest-review | deviation 0 within tolerance 0.5 |

## Measurement Evidence

| Claim | Method | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The wind-down synthesis and master plan documents exist and are linked from README.md. | file-and-readme-review | docs/research/PROJECT-TELOS-RESEARCH-WINDDOWN-2026-07-02.md exists; docs/PROJECT-TELOS-MASTER-PLAN-2026-07-02.md exists; README.md links both deliverables |
| The research corpus inventory records at least 150 pass ledgers, 163 packets, 445 schema artifacts, 147 Crucible run records, and 26 Gather source stores. | filesystem-inventory | pass_ledgers>=150; packets>=163; schemas>=445; crucible_runs>=147; gather_stores>=26 |
| Pass 0151 records the final frontier-problem source federation with 83 candidate sources, 24 Gather-verified captures, 12 problem lanes, and 8 admission gates. | artifact-review | schema=FrontierProblemSourceFederationReceipt/v1; candidate_sources=83; gather_verified=24; problem_lanes=12; admission_gates=8 |
| The master plan covers Gather, Index, Forum, Crucible, Telos, Learn, BuildLang/buildc, and Emet as named pillars. | document-review | Project Telos Master Plan includes System Pillars sections for all required names |
| The wind-down deliverables preserve boundaries: they do not claim current proof of new laws of physics, clinical efficacy, or raw-scale frontier model superiority. | boundary-review | wind-down synthesis has explicit low-confidence/fenced claims; master plan says not to compete only on raw pretraining scale first |
| The run corpus manifest records 150 pass-ledger rows through pass 0151. | manifest-review | docs/research/PROJECT-TELOS-RUN-CORPUS-MANIFEST-2026-07-02.md exists; pass-ledger rows=150; latest row includes pass-0151-ledger.md |
