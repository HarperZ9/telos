# Packet 007: Visual, Color, and Rendering Measurement

Status: local substrate `SOURCE_BACKED` plus `HYPOTHESIS`

## Question

Can Telos make visual outputs reviewable by joining source, rendering state, color transform, display assumptions, and measurement gates?

## Local Anchors

- Telos display calibration contract.
- Telos measurement layers.
- Build Color.
- Calibrate Pro.
- proof-surface and proof-surface-report.

## External Anchors

- ACES: https://www.oscars.org/science-technology/sci-tech-projects/aces
- OpenColorIO: https://opencolorio.org/
- Calman: https://www.portrait.com/products/
- ColourSpace: https://lightillusion.com/colourspace.html
- DaVinci Resolve Color: https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve/color

## Working Thesis

Visual truth is a strong public demo domain because humans can inspect an artifact while Telos records the source and measurement chain.

Confidence: moderate-high for demo value; low for any hardware calibration claim without a sensor-backed measurement.

## Non-Mutation Boundary

First demos must be read-only:

- no DDC/CI mutation;
- no ICC profile installation;
- no LUT application;
- no display-state changes;
- no claims about actual hardware calibration without sensor evidence.

## Adversarial Steelman

Objection: existing color tools already generate reports.

Response: valid. Telos should wrap those reports into a larger proof packet that includes model/source/action/provenance and verifier state. It should not claim to be a better colorimeter.

## Next Proof Attempt

Generate a read-only visual proof packet containing an image artifact hash, declared color assumptions, Build Color metric output, display-calibration caveats, and Crucible measurement-gate result.
