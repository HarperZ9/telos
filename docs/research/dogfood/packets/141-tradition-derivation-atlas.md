# Packet 141: Tradition Derivation Atlas

Date: 2026-07-01

Status: `TRADITION_DERIVATION_ATLAS_MATCH`

Purpose: expand the Brandom functional-learning lane into a sampled,
source-backed tradition atlas that can drive prerequisite paths, contrast
classes, learner exercises, and overclaim gates.

## Learning Modules

| Module | Verifier |
| --- | --- |
| source_trace | every concept edge names source refs |
| contrast_class | learner names inherited and rejected commitments |
| prerequisite_path | all path nodes exist in atlas |
| inferential_rewrite | answer contains claim, rule, consequence, and objection |
| overclaim_audit | unsupported causality and completeness claims are rejected |

## Product Hypotheses

| Tool | Status | Wedge |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tradition Derivation Atlas | HYPOTHESIS | source-backed intellectual dependency maps with explicit overclaim gates |
| Concept Prerequisite Tutor | HYPOTHESIS | turns dense theory into prerequisite paths and checkable exercises |
| Citation-to-Exercise Studio | HYPOTHESIS | converts citation clusters into learner tasks, objections, and repair receipts |
| Research Lineage Packet | HYPOTHESIS | packages tradition edges with provenance, confidence, and falsifiers |

## Boundary

Pass 0131 builds a sampled, source-backed tradition atlas. Edges are prerequisite or contrast hypotheses, not complete genealogy, causality proof, learning-efficacy evidence, or natural-law promotion.
