# Packet 059: Wedge Budget-Signal Scorecard

Date: 2026-07-01

Status: `WEDGE_BUDGET_SIGNAL_SCORECARD_MATCH`

This pass converts the 45-row market matrix into a ranked buyer-urgency
and budget-access scorecard. Pricing pages verify budget signaling;
they do not prove willingness to buy Telos.

| Rank | Market | Score | Budget signals | Primary push |
| ---: | --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| 1 | `agent_action_proof_packets` | 34 | 7 | `True` |
| 2 | `research_proof_packets` | 31 | 3 | `False` |
| 3 | `buildlang_runtime_receipts` | 28 | 4 | `False` |

Primary 30-day market push: `agent_action_proof_packets`.

Reason: it has the strongest combination of urgent buyer pain, existing
pricing/budget signals, demo readiness, and direct reuse as the substrate
for research proof packets and BuildLang/runtime receipts.

Current promoted natural laws: none.
