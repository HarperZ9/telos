Date: 2026-07-01

Status: `BRANDOM_WORK_LESSON_GRAPH_MATCH`

Purpose: deepen the Brandom corpus from pass 0129 into a work-level catalog
and a bounded lesson graph for functional learning tooling.

## Boundary

Pass 0130 catalogs five gathered Brandom texts/course pages and builds a bounded lesson graph. It does not export PDF bodies, prove learning efficacy, complete Brandom's bibliography, or promote philosophical claims as natural laws.
