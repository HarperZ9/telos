# Packet 004: Biology and Autonomous Labs

Status: `SOURCE_LEAD` plus high-risk `HYPOTHESIS`

## Question

Can Telos provide accountable research proof packets for biology agents and autonomous lab workflows?

## Source Anchors

- FutureHouse: https://www.futurehouse.org/
- NVIDIA BioNeMo Agent Toolkit release: https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-launches-bionemo-agent-toolkit-giving-ai-agents-the-tools-to-accelerate-scientific-discovery
- Benchling automation: https://www.benchling.com/automation
- Coscientist paper: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06792-0

## Working Thesis

Biology needs proof packets because literature, model reasoning, wet-lab protocol, instrument execution, sample identity, and analysis results are usually reviewed through separate systems.

Confidence: moderate for need; low for any claim of biological discovery by Telos today.

## Required Packet Fields

- source literature and dataset references;
- sample identity references;
- protocol version;
- model proposal;
- admission decision for lab action;
- instrument/workcell execution reference;
- raw-data pointer or digest;
- analysis script or notebook digest;
- verifier verdict;
- human-review status.

## Adversarial Steelman

Objection: Benchling, ELNs, LIMS, automation platforms, and BioNeMo-style toolkits already live in this domain.

Response: Telos should not replace them. It should attach source/action/verdict packets around high-stakes claims and agent-proposed actions.

## Next Proof Attempt

Use a public, non-wet-lab bioinformatics workflow first: literature claim -> public dataset -> analysis script -> result digest -> Crucible verdict.
