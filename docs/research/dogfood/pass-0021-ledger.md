Pass theme: pinned quantum framework-import environment plan and first
OpenTelemetry action-bridge fixture. This pass advances pass 0020 from market
map into an executable-boundary plan without installing packages or pretending
that unavailable frameworks are integrated.

No quantum SDK installation, unavailable framework import, cloud credential,
provider job, quantum hardware result, buyer-demand proof, theorem proof,
natural law, biological result, material result, medical result, finance result,
or safety result is promoted in this pass.

## Environment Plan

Plan seal:

```text

```

Validator result:

```text
status = MATCH
match = 1
drift = 0
package_plan_count = 11
negative_fixture_count = 9
source_anchor_count = 15
otel_status = API_IMPORT_MATCH_NONRECORDING
```

Local environment:

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Python | `3.12.10` |
| pip | `26.1.2` |
| Platform | `Windows-11-10.0.26220-SP0` |
| Boundary | `PLAN_ONLY_NO_PACKAGE_INSTALL` |

## Package Plans

All package plans set:

```text
install_now=false
pin_policy=RESOLVE_IN_ISOLATED_ENV_THEN_FREEZE_WITH_HASHES
cloud_credentials_required_for_import_fixture=false
```

Planned distributions:

- `qiskit`;
- `qiskit-ibm-runtime`;
- `amazon-braket-sdk`;
- `cirq`;
- `pennylane`;
- `pyqir`;
- `pytket`;
- `pytket-qir`;
- `cudaq`;
- `opentelemetry-api`;
- `opentelemetry-sdk`.

## OpenTelemetry Fixture

`opentelemetry-api` was already available locally and was imported. The fixture
created an API-only span:

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| API version | `1.41.0` |
| Span class | `NonRecordingSpan` |
| Recording | `false` |
| Trace ID | `00000000000000000000000000000000` |
| Span ID | `0000000000000000` |
| Attribute status | `NOT_RECORDED_WITH_API_ONLY_NONRECORDING_SPAN` |
| Fixture hash | `a95002a2f3db465b1b460dc66fade557da46c1c70f8bac68dc149723167b6f90` |

The result is intentionally fenced: `opentelemetry-api` can shape the action
receipt mapping, but an API-only `NonRecordingSpan` is not exported trace
evidence.

## Promotion Gates

Pass 0021 records these gates:

- isolated environment required;
- resolve and freeze with hashes required;
- no cloud credentials for framework-import fixtures;
- no provider execution without live-provider receipt;
- SDK import does not prove provider execution;
- OTel API non-recording span does not prove exported trace;
- Build runtime receipts required for BuildLang/buildc promotion;
- measured-output receipts required for color/rendering promotion.

## QuantumProofDemo Contract

The first public demo target is:

```text
source anchors -> workspace context -> framework import -> circuit/program
-> canonical result -> negative fixtures -> OTel action bridge -> Crucible verdict
```

The same packet shape is reserved for BuildLang/buildc numerical kernels and
Build Color measured-output kernels.

## Negative Fixtures

| Fixture | Expected Result |
| --- | --- |
| `negative-installing-into-shared-base-env` | `REJECT` |
| `negative-unpinned-runtime-demo` | `REJECT` |
| `negative-cloud-credential-required-for-import-fixture` | `REJECT` |
| `negative-sdk-import-claimed-as-provider-execution` | `REJECT` |
| `negative-nonrecording-otel-span-claimed-as-exported-trace` | `REJECT` |
| `negative-cudaq-import-claimed-as-gpu-acceleration` | `REJECT` |
| `negative-qir-without-record-map` | `REJECT` |
| `negative-buildlang-runtime-without-compiler-receipt` | `REJECT` |
| `negative-color-runtime-without-measurement-receipt` | `REJECT` |

## Tool Substrate Receipt

Pass 0021 refreshed the tool surfaces:

| Tool | Status | Note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Index | `MATCH` | Version 2.8.0; structure-context role observed. |
| Gather | `MATCH` | Version 1.5.0; packet read verified. |
| Telos | `MATCH` | Operator doctor reports 14/14 checks passing and 65 tools. |
| Forum | `MATCH_WITH_SUBMIT_GAP` | Ledger status/verify works; submit remains `UNVERIFIABLE` due to executor JSON parsing. |
| Crucible | `MATCH` | Version 1.1.0; pass 0021 assessment matched. |

Forum ledger status after the pass-0021 submit attempt:

Gather docs receipt for packet 031:

## Source Anchors

The schema stores 15 source anchors for Qiskit, Qiskit Runtime, Braket SDK,
Cirq, PennyLane, PyQIR, pytket, pytket-QIR, CUDA-Q, pip, and OpenTelemetry
Python/API trace documentation.

## Primary Next Push

Choose one minimal executable proof path:

1. `opentelemetry-sdk` in-memory recording span fixture, or
2. a single-framework local import fixture, preferably Cirq-only or
   Qiskit-only.

The safer next pass is OTel SDK first because it exercises the action-receipt
bridge without widening quantum dependencies.

## Natural-Law Promotion

Current promoted natural laws: none.

## Next-Pass Queue

1. Add `OpenTelemetryRecordingSpanFixture/v1` using an isolated or already
   available SDK path.
2. If SDK is unavailable, define an environment lockfile contract instead of
   installing packages into the shared workspace.
3. After OTel recording works, create one local framework-import fixture:
   Cirq-only or Qiskit-only.
4. Start `QuantumProofDemo/v1` as the public proof packet that combines source,
   framework import, canonical result, negative fixtures, action receipts, and
   Crucible verdict.
