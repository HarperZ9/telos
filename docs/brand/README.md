# telos brand assets

Current assets, rendered on 4 October 2026 from the shared art direction:

- `docs/art/hero-dark.svg`, `docs/art/hero-light.svg`: the README hero, 1280 x 480, text outlined from Hanken Grotesk and Conso.
- `docs/art/social.png`: the GitHub social preview, 1280 x 640.
- The mark: `docs/brand/mark-16.png`, `docs/brand/mark-32.png` and `docs/brand/mark-16.svg` (favicon sizes),
  `docs/brand/mark-64.png`, `docs/brand/mark-512.png` and `docs/brand/mark-tile.svg` (app and listing icons),
  `docs/brand/mark-light.svg` and `docs/brand/mark-dark.svg` (on a page, no tile).
- The lockups: `docs/brand/lockup-horizontal-light.svg`, `docs/brand/lockup-horizontal-dark.svg`,
  `docs/brand/lockup-stacked-light.svg` and `docs/brand/lockup-stacked-dark.svg`.
- `docs/art/receipts.json`: a `superstack.receipt/1` for every PNG, with the seed, the scene hash and the font hashes.

The seed is the repository name. The same seed gives the same SVG bytes.

The previous README header, `docs/art/telos-header.svg`, stays in the repository with its `docs/art/telos.art.json` record.

The record below describes the previous brand render and stays as it was written.

## Previous render

The README hero image in this folder was refreshed on 2026-06-29 as part of the Project Telos rendering dogfood pass.

## Rendering Receipt

- Source contract: `telos.rendering.research` in the Telos repository.
- Renderer: `project-telos.brand-render/v2`, maintained in `telos/tools/render_flagship_heroes.py`.
- Visual research lane: Gaussian-splatting fields, clustered-forward lighting grids, visible state overlays, retro CGI texture, dithering, and receipt-first UI composition.
- Critique lane: `r/design`, `r/design_critiques`, and `r/posterdesign` are used as non-evidentiary presentation references for hierarchy, focal control, poster readability, and effect restraint.
- Product role: shared state and verification membrane.
- Tool-specific motif: membrane arcs and receipt state.
- Typography: this hero PNG was rendered locally on 2026-06-29 with Kilon and Conso. Kilon was retired on 2026-10-04, and renders after that date set display type in Hanken Grotesk. The public repository carries only the exported artwork, not the font files.
- Accessibility floor: high-contrast foreground text, a solid no-texture text field, non-color-only status labels, and static PNG fallback for GitHub and low-capability hosts.
- Provenance boundary: Reddit and community links are treated as non-evidentiary source leads; implementation claims resolve through lawful papers, standards, official repositories, and repeatable local checks.

## Reproducibility

From the Telos repository, verify the committed five-flagship artwork without private fonts:

```bash
python tools/render_flagship_heroes.py --check-existing --public-root ..
```

Regenerate locally with the operator-owned font ZIPs and Pillow:

```bash
python tools/render_flagship_heroes.py --render --public-root ..
```
