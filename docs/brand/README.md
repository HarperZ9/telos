# Telos Brand Assets

The README hero image in this folder was refreshed on 2026-06-29 as part of the Project Telos rendering dogfood pass.

## Rendering Receipt

- Source contract: `telos.rendering.research` in the Telos repository.
- Renderer: `project-telos.brand-render/v2`, maintained in `telos/tools/render_flagship_heroes.py`.
- Visual research lane: Gaussian-splatting fields, clustered-forward lighting grids, visible state overlays, retro CGI texture, dithering, and receipt-first UI composition.
- Critique lane: `r/design`, `r/design_critiques`, and `r/posterdesign` are used as non-evidentiary presentation references for hierarchy, focal control, poster readability, and effect restraint.
- Product role: shared state and verification membrane.
- Tool-specific motif: membrane arcs and receipt state.
- Typography: rendered locally from the operator-owned Kilon and Conso font packages. The public repository carries only the exported artwork, not the purchased font files.
- Accessibility floor: high-contrast foreground text, a solid no-texture text field, non-color-only status labels, and static PNG fallback for GitHub and low-capability hosts.
- Provenance boundary: Reddit and community links are treated as non-evidentiary source leads; implementation claims resolve through lawful papers, standards, official repositories, and repeatable local checks.

## Reproducibility

From the Telos repository, verify the committed five-flagship artwork without private fonts:

```bash
python tools/render_flagship_heroes.py --check-existing --public-root ..
```

Regenerate locally with the operator-owned font ZIPs and Pillow:

```bash
python tools/render_flagship_heroes.py --render --public-root ..
```
