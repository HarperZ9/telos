# Seventh-Wave Reddit And YouTube Comment Queue

Date: 2026-07-02

Purpose: expand Project Telos visibility into Reddit, YouTube, and adjacent technical communities with contextual comments around physics, quantitative finance, AI agents, ML reproducibility, MCP reliability, and local-first tooling.

## Posting Posture

Use the aged Reddit/YouTube accounts for real technical participation, not link spraying.

- Prefer no-link comments unless the thread explicitly asks for tools, repos, or workflows.
- Lead with the local engineering idea: receipts, source provenance, context maps, action logs, verifier verdicts, and blocked handoffs.
- Mention Project Telos only when the thread is already about tooling, agents, MCP, reproducibility, or workflow infrastructure.
- When linking, use one link only: `https://github.com/HarperZ9/telos`.
- Do not post identical comments across targets. Keep the same thesis, but vary the framing.
- Pace the first run: 6 to 10 high-fit comments, then wait for replies before widening.

Browser/posting rule: comments may be staged in the browser, but final submission is an external public side effect and needs action-time confirmation with exact destination and text.

## Current Tooling Claims Safe To Use

- Current Telos catalog reports 70 available tools across Gather, Index, Forum, Crucible, and Telos.
- Gather status reports `1.5.0` and `MATCH`.
- Index status reports `2.8.0` and `MATCH`.
- Forum doctor reports `1.12.0` and `MATCH`.
- The current outreach packages emphasize evidence-gated work: intake can be live; readiness stays blocked until reproduction, tests, patch summary, and verifier evidence exist.

Avoid claiming that Telos has fixed a specific upstream project unless a patch, tests, and public PR receipt exist.

## First Batch: Reddit

### R1 - r/LocalLLaMA: agent browser use

URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1uh0uz7/whats_the_latest_on_agent_browser_use/

Reason: fresh thread, directly asks about long browser workflows.

Draft:

> For long browser workflows, the part I trust least is giving the model more DOM and hoping it stays coherent. The pattern that has held up better for me is: agent discovers the flow, the stable path becomes versioned code or an action receipt, and the model only re-enters on drift/failure. I am testing that shape in Project Telos with browser evidence packets and action receipts, but the useful idea is simple: every run should preserve what sources were read, what actions happened, what checks ran, and what remains unverifiable.

### R2 - r/LocalLLaMA: local AI workflow

URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1ugba2x/whats_one_local_ai_workflow_you_wish_youd/

Reason: recent thread asking for local workflows; good fit for Telos as a local workbench.

Draft:

> One workflow worth adding: local intake -> context map -> verified action receipt. I use a five-part loop for that shape now: capture sources with provenance, map the workspace, route the task, gate claims, and keep action receipts. It is less glamorous than a fully autonomous agent, but for multi-hour work it saves more time because you know exactly what changed, what was checked, and what is still unknown.

Link variant:

> One workflow worth adding: local intake -> context map -> verified action receipt. I am building that loop in Project Telos: Gather for source provenance, Index for workspace maps, Forum for routing, Crucible for verification, and Telos for the shared workbench. Repo if useful: https://github.com/HarperZ9/telos

### R3 - r/LocalLLaMA: best local agents

URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1uaebfe/best_local_agents_jun_2026/

Reason: recent local-agent recommendation thread; one repo link is appropriate if positioned as tooling.

Draft:

> For local agents, I care less about the controller and more about the evidence layer around it: what files did it read, what context got selected, what did it run, what came back, and what claims are still unverifiable. Telos is my local-first workbench for that. Current source-checkout catalog reports 70 available tools across Gather, Index, Forum, Crucible, and Telos: https://github.com/HarperZ9/telos

### R4 - r/quant: AI-generated code

URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/quant/comments/1uiyav8/is_anyone_else_struggling_with_aigenerated_code/

Reason: fresh quant thread, direct fit for receipts around generated code and backtests.

Draft:

> Short leash is the right frame. In quant code I would not trust a generated backtest or strategy unless the agent also produces run receipts: data assumptions, exact commands, versioned diffs, failing/passing tests, and explicit unknown/unverified labels. The useful workflow is not "AI writes quant code"; it is "AI surfaces hypotheses and glue, then verification blocks the handoff until the result is reproducible."

### R5 - r/Physics: computational physics with AI

URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/1ua11eb/computational_physics_scope_with_ai/

Reason: recent physics thread about hybrid AI workflow and preserving craft.

Draft:

> That hybrid workflow sounds solid: keep the solver, physics invariants, and numerical assumptions hand-owned; use AI mostly for review, tests, profiling, and alternate derivations. The missing piece is making the review auditable. I would want a short receipt for each AI pass: files/equations inspected, invariants checked, tests run, performance claims verified, and what the model could not verify. That keeps speed from becoming a silent loss of craft.

### R6 - r/Physics: physics PhD using ML

URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/1ua2pbw/physics_phd_focused_on_using_machine_learning/

Reason: recent physics/ML thread; useful non-promotional advice with optional tooling mention only if asked.

Draft:

> I would treat the ML part like an experimental apparatus rather than a shortcut. Before committing, make sure you can define the physical baseline, the data-generation path, failure cases, and what "better than the baseline" means. Then keep a reproducibility receipt for every run: config, data version, seed, metrics, plots, and the failure mode. That habit matters more than any specific framework at the start.

### R7 - r/MachineLearning: reproducing papers

URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1t4dkew/struggling_to_reproduce_paper_results_before/

Reason: reproducibility is one of the strongest Telos positioning lanes.

Draft:

> The tool I want for this is not another paper summary agent; it is a receipt builder. For each reproduction attempt: environment, exact command, dataset/version, hidden assumptions, traceback, patch diff, and a verdict like MATCH/DRIFT/UNVERIFIABLE. That makes partial failures reusable instead of every lab restarting from a vague README issue.

### R8 - r/MachineLearning: code sharing and NeurIPS

URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1ss12tp/neurips_2026_will_you_be_submitting_your_code/

Reason: code-release debate; Telos can frame reproducibility receipts without telling authors to expose everything immediately.

Draft:

> I would split "public code" from "verifiable receipt." If full release timing is sensitive, reviewers still need a bounded reproduction packet: dependency lock, run command, ablation availability, redacted/proxy-data notes, and explicit not-yet-public pieces. Coding agents make code easier to transform, but they also make receipt-backed provenance more important, not less.

### R9 - r/LocalLLaMA: MCP reliability

URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1sagzql/i_analyzed_2181_remote_mcp_server_endpoints_heres/

Reason: direct MCP reliability conversation; good fit for freshness probes.

Draft:

> The reliability issue I keep hitting is freshness drift: source says one tool surface, host-loaded MCP server exposes another. A useful gate is catalog + manifest + server launch probe + version/status probe before wiring an endpoint into a workflow. That catches stale local servers too, not just remote uptime.

### R10 - r/LocalLLaMA: favorite local MCP server

URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1tpwg33/whats_your_favorite_local_mcp_server/

Reason: tool recommendation thread; repo link appropriate.

Draft:

> I am biased because I am building it, but Project Telos is becoming my local MCP workbench: Gather for source intake, Index for workspace structure, Forum for routing, Crucible for verification, and Telos for shared receipts/catalogs. Current source-checkout catalog reports 70 available tools. It is aimed less at "one more MCP server" and more at making agent work auditable: https://github.com/HarperZ9/telos

## First Batch: YouTube

### Y1 - AI Physics, Surrogate Models, and Agentic Workflows

URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHBkgDcHuS8

Draft:

> This is exactly where agentic workflows need receipts, not just orchestration. For AI-physics and surrogate-model loops, each agent step should preserve source refs, run configs, failed assumptions, and verifier output so the engineer can tell "simulation accelerated" from "workflow got opaque."

Link variant:

> This is exactly where agentic workflows need receipts, not just orchestration. For AI-physics and surrogate-model loops, each agent step should preserve source refs, run configs, failed assumptions, and verifier output. I am building that evidence-gated pattern in Project Telos: https://github.com/HarperZ9/telos

### Y2 - Rescale: Scaling Simulation And HPC With Agentic Workflows

URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1VMKlntQxU

Draft:

> One practical pattern for HPC agent workflows: split intake from readiness. The agent can discover candidates, prepare setup, and draft commands, but the handoff should stay blocked until reproduction command, solver/test output, and review receipt exist. That boundary matters when compute is expensive.

### Y3 - Prof. Nathan Kutz On Physics-Informed AI

URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdlE5q8yHpw

Draft:

> Physics-informed AI really needs traceable workflows. The question is not just whether a surrogate is accurate once; it is whether the data, assumptions, constraints, solver settings, and evaluation path can be reconstructed by another person later. Agent workflows should carry that receipt chain by default.

### Y4 - FastMCP Tutorial

URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6SPMINZfPk

Draft:

> Useful tutorial. The part I would add around MCP servers is freshness verification: catalog expected tools, manifest expected server versions, probe the loaded host surface, and fail closed if the source checkout and loaded MCP server diverge. Stale tool surfaces are hard to debug once an agent is already mid-task.

Link variant:

> Useful tutorial. The part I would add around MCP servers is freshness verification: catalog expected tools, manifest expected server versions, probe the loaded host surface, and fail closed if the source checkout and loaded MCP server diverge. I am working on this in Telos: https://github.com/HarperZ9/telos

### Y5 - The Future Of MCP

URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3Fr2JR47KA

Draft:

> MCP needs a verification story as much as an integration story. The failure mode I see is tool-surface drift: a host loads an older server while source/tests/docs are current. Catalog/manifest/status probes before agent work have been the most useful guardrail in my experiments.

### Y6 - AI Agent Inside Network CLI

URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shGjxZKKa6o

Draft:

> For CLI/network agents, the accountability layer matters: command admission, exact command receipt, stdout/stderr capture, verifier result, and a human-readable summary of what changed and what remains unknown. That is the difference between an agent that is convenient and one you can let near real infrastructure.

### Y7 - AI Agents vs Workflows: What Changed

URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrLU6BS_JFo

Draft:

> The useful distinction for me is not agent vs workflow, but reversible vs unrecoverable work. A workflow can be mostly deterministic and still call an agent at ambiguity points. The key is that every step emits enough receipt data that a human can replay, block, or repair the handoff.

### Y8 - Agentic Digital Engineering And AI Physics Deep Dive

URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6q06vB9T_8

Draft:

> Agentic digital engineering needs a "blocked until proven" layer. It is fine for an agent to scout setup paths or generate commands, but engineering handoff should require explicit evidence: source refs, run config, output artifacts, failed cases, and reviewer/verifier status.

## Second Batch: Expanded Targets

### R11 - r/quant: future of coding in financial industry

URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/quant/comments/1r11ekm/the_future_of_coding_in_the_financial_industry/

Reason: quant thread about AI coding tool adoption.

Draft:

> The adoption curve matters less than the control surface. For quant teams, an AI coding workflow needs hard receipts: data lineage, exact backtest command, generated diff, reviewer notes, tests, and explicit "not verified" labels. Otherwise the speed gain just moves risk into places where it is harder to see.

### R12 - r/quant: AI IDEs at work

URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/quant/comments/1pcubv9/do_use_ai_ide_in_work/

Reason: practical quant tooling thread; useful fit for local-first workflow positioning.

Draft:

> The IDE choice is secondary to the boundary around it. I would want local context selection, no uncontrolled data egress, command receipts, and a review gate before code touches research/backtest output. Cursor/Copilot/Codex/Claude can all help, but the team needs a workflow that records what the agent saw and what was actually verified.

### R13 - r/quant: AI assistant spend / usage limits

URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/quant/comments/1tkwayo/genuine_question_how_much_cursor_spend_does_your/

Reason: recent quant thread about firm-level AI assistant policy.

Draft:

> Spend limits are less interesting than audit limits. I would rather give engineers generous access with strict local receipts: what repo context was sent, what commands ran, what generated changes were accepted, and what tests or backtests proved. Without that, both "unlimited" and "banned" are blunt policies.

### R14 - r/quant: quant projects coded using LLM

URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/quant/comments/1lma51i/quant_projects_coded_using_llm/

Reason: older but directly on AI-generated quant projects; use only if still active or relevant.

Draft:

> LLM-coded quant projects are fine as scaffolding if the verification layer is stronger than the generation layer. The model can write a lot of code quickly; it cannot make the strategy valid. I would insist on reproducible data pulls, deterministic backtest commands, baseline comparisons, and saved failure cases before treating any result as more than a prototype.

### Y9 - AI Agent Systems: Architectures, Applications, and Evaluation

URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNfcOt1HzkA

Draft:

> Evaluation for agents should include the evidence trail, not just final task success. A run that succeeds but cannot show selected context, tools called, command outputs, rejected claims, and verifier status is hard to reuse or debug.

### Y10 - AI analyst / finance agents

URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Kk2W0APDmI

Draft:

> For finance agents, I would treat "mathematical rigor" as a receipt problem: exact data inputs, decimal/precision assumptions, formulas used, generated code diff, command output, and reviewer/verifier status. Otherwise parallel agents can sound rigorous while still hiding the weak step.

### Y11 - Physics-informed stable agents

URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Px0a9eexeu8

Draft:

> Physics-inspired agent stability is interesting, but I would still want a practical receipt layer: what state was observed, which constraints were applied, what action was admitted, and why the verifier allowed or blocked the next step. Stability claims need traceable state transitions.

### Y12 - Will AI Discover New Physics?

URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Syimp9ehHFA

Draft:

> The discovery question needs a careful workflow boundary. AI can help generate hypotheses and search model space, but the durable value comes from reproducible packets: data source, assumptions, equations or surrogate structure, falsification attempts, and what remained unexplained.

### Y13 - AI Coding Agents: The Good, The Bad, The Ugly

URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5D_1TwHSjfA

Draft:

> The "bad and ugly" usually show up when agent work has no durable receipt. I want every coding-agent run to preserve selected context, generated diff, commands/tests, failures, and explicit unverifiable claims. That turns an impressive demo into something a maintainer can review.

### Y14 - From Chaos to Control: ML Reproducibility at Scale

URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZGSwF4HRlM

Draft:

> Reproducibility at scale should include partial-failure receipts. If a run fails, the environment, data version, command, traceback, and suspected hidden assumption should still become reusable evidence. That is where agents can help: not by hiding the mess, but by packaging it.
