## Verdicts

| Claim | Status | Disposition | Margin | Method | Grounds |
| --- | --- | --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| The eighth-wave local reproduction receipt records pandas-dev/pandas#63458 with Python 3.12.10, pandas 3.0.3, pyarrow 24.0.0, and reproduction status failed-before-patch. | MATCH | fenced | 1 | local-reproduction-receipt-review | deviation 0 within tolerance 0.5 |
| The eighth-wave blocked readiness packet remains not PR-ready and lists blockers for missing passing test evidence, non-MATCH verifier verdict, and missing patch summary. | MATCH | fenced | 1 | blocked-readiness-packet-review | deviation 0 within tolerance 0.5 |
| The eighth-wave arXiv intake captured 14 retained paper source leads across three Gather stores. | MATCH | fenced | 1 | gather-arxiv-store-review | deviation 0 within tolerance 0.5 |
| The proof-carrying research loops working paper defines the stricter promotion ladder and keeps paper/source claims fenced. | MATCH | fenced | 1 | whitepaper-boundary-review | deviation 0 within tolerance 0.5 |
| The eighth-wave outreach package distinguishes local failing reproduction, readiness, source leads, website copy, and official paper submission boundaries. | MATCH | fenced | 1 | outreach-boundary-review | deviation 0 within tolerance 0.5 |

## Measurement Evidence

| Claim | Method | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The eighth-wave local reproduction receipt records pandas-dev/pandas#63458 with Python 3.12.10, pandas 3.0.3, pyarrow 24.0.0, and reproduction status failed-before-patch. | local-reproduction-receipt-review | docs/outreach/receipts/eighth-wave/pandas-63458-repro/local-reproduction-receipt.json has schema project-telos.local-reproduction-receipt/v1; candidate is pandas-dev/pandas#63458; environment python is 3.12.10; environment pandas is 3.0.3; environment pyarrow is 24.0.0; reproduction status is failed-before-patch |
| The eighth-wave blocked readiness packet remains not PR-ready and lists blockers for missing passing test evidence, non-MATCH verifier verdict, and missing patch summary. | blocked-readiness-packet-review | docs/outreach/receipts/eighth-wave/pandas-63458-repro/local-reproduction-blocked-packet.json has schema project-telos.oss-pr-readiness/v1; packet pr_ready is false; packet operator_next_action is revise; packet blockers include missing passing test evidence, crucible verdict is not MATCH, and missing patch summary |
| The eighth-wave arXiv intake captured 14 retained paper source leads across three Gather stores. | gather-arxiv-store-review | docs/outreach/receipts/eighth-wave/arxiv-agentic-science/catalog.jsonl has 5 rows; docs/outreach/receipts/eighth-wave/arxiv-formal-proof/catalog.jsonl has 5 rows; docs/outreach/receipts/eighth-wave/arxiv-ai4science/catalog.jsonl has 4 rows; total retained rows is 14 |
| The proof-carrying research loops working paper defines the stricter promotion ladder and keeps paper/source claims fenced. | whitepaper-boundary-review | docs/research/whitepapers/PROOF-CARRYING-RESEARCH-LOOPS-2026-07-02.md defines SOURCE_LEAD, HYPOTHESIS, IDENTITY, PROBE_MATCH, CRUCIBLE_MATCH, UNVERIFIABLE, LAW_CANDIDATE, and PROMOTED_LAW; same paper says arXiv papers are SOURCE_LEAD material and Gather verifies metadata capture, not paper truth; same paper says no promoted natural laws are promoted here |
| The eighth-wave outreach package distinguishes local failing reproduction, readiness, source leads, website copy, and official paper submission boundaries. | outreach-boundary-review | docs/outreach/EIGHTH-WAVE-LOCAL-REPRODUCTION-AND-PUBLISHING-PIPELINE-2026-07-02.md says not to claim a pandas fix, source inspection, tests passed, current-main verification, arXiv truth, official submission, or new natural law; docs/outreach/EIGHTH-WAVE-CONTENT-QUEUE-2026-07-02.md says every research post needs a status label |
