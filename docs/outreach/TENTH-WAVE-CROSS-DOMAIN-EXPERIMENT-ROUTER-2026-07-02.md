# Tenth-Wave Cross-Domain Experiment Router

Date: 2026-07-02

Status: source-led planning packet

Evidence boundary: arXiv metadata, public program anchors, local demotion gate, and tool receipts only. This packet does not claim new physics, new materials, climate-model validation, neuroscience truth, theorem proof, quantum hardware validation, or solved grand challenges.

## Purpose

The ninth wave proved that source capture must not become a truth claim. The tenth wave extends that lesson across five harder frontier lanes:

- quantum error correction and quantum networking
- materials discovery, batteries, catalysis, and energy storage
- climate AI, uncertainty, and data assimilation
- neuroscience, cognitive science, and brain/AI convergence
- formal verification, proof assistants, and AI theorem proving

The product thesis is an experiment router: every source lead is converted into the smallest falsifiable proof packet the current Telos stack can honestly support. The router does not "solve the field." It chooses the next verifiable experiment shape.

## Public Program Anchors

These anchors are not proof of our claims. They explain why the lanes matter and why the product shape should be cross-domain:

| Domain | Anchor | Implication for Telos |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Energy and materials | DOE Basic Energy Sciences supports research spanning energy generation, conversion, transmission, storage, and use. | Materials and energy work needs source, model, measurement, facility, and uncertainty receipts before product claims. |
| DOE Office of Science | DOE describes itself as a major supporter of physics, materials science, computing, and chemistry. | The Telos research loop should handle physics/materials/computing claims as connected evidence objects, not isolated notes. |
| Quantum | National Quantum Initiative reporting frames QIS coordination as a long-horizon national R&D effort. | Quantum source leads need hardware/simulator/proof separation and strict noise-model boundaries. |
| AI/neuroscience | NSF AI institutes include interdisciplinary neuroscience, cognitive science, and AI work. | Brain/AI claims need source-body review, benchmark receipts, cognitive-task boundaries, and no anthropomorphic overclaim. |
| Climate | NOAA climate resources provide public climate data and adaptation information. | Climate proof packets need data provenance, uncertainty, scenario boundaries, model versioning, and public-claim review. |

## High-Signal Experiment Leads

These are proposed next proof packets, not domain results.

| Lead | Lane | Proposed proof packet | First verifiable check |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `2512.02760v1` fault-tolerant quantum computation with constant overhead | Quantum | Noise-model and overhead-claim packet. | Extract assumptions, code/simulator refs, theorem claims, and falsifiers from source body. |
| `2602.12459v1` causality-preserving measurement scheduling in quantum networks | Quantum | Quantum-network scheduling receipt. | Represent scheduling constraints as a small graph feasibility check. |
| `2508.03278v1` AI/generative models for materials discovery | Materials | Materials-discovery claim taxonomy packet. | Split survey claims into benchmark, wet-lab, simulation, and review states. |
| `2502.14912v2` chemical element embeddings for materials inference | Materials | Embedding-provenance and benchmark packet. | Check whether evaluation data, split protocol, and uncertainty are source-verifiable. |
| `2312.03014v1` weather/climate foundation-model survey | Climate | Climate-model evidence-state packet. | Extract data sources, forecast horizons, uncertainty reporting, and scenario scope. |
| `2603.26449v1` ClimateCheck 2026 | Climate | Public-claim verification packet. | Model source-to-claim citation, narrative class, and fact-check verdict separation. |
| `2512.02419v1` brain/AI convergence | Neuroscience | Brain/AI claim-boundary packet. | Separate computational analogy, empirical neuroscience, benchmark, and philosophical claims. |
| `2604.16347v1` Lean Atlas | Formal verification | Human-AI formalization workflow packet. | Check toolchain, proof object, environment, and replay claims separately. |
| `2504.17017v2` neural theorem proving | Formal verification | Proof-structure and replay packet. | Require replayable proof artifacts before any theorem-success claim. |

## Query Noise And Adjacent Leads

The repeated appearance of general rows is useful. It shows where the current query layer still leaks broad AI/vision/governance items into domain lanes.

| Row | Handling |
| --- | --- |
| `2604.11487v1` robust AI-generated image detection | Adjacent to provenance and media verification; not climate/neuroscience/formal proof evidence without a separate packet. |
| `2601.16513v1` ethical AI case study | Governance context only. |
| `2602.21012v1` international AI safety report | Safety-policy context only. |
| `2603.08092v1` speaker verification challenge | Query noise for formal proof. |
| `2605.14495v1` multimedia verification debate | Adjacent to verification workflows, not theorem proving. |
| `2607.01063v1` software testing competition | Agent/tooling source lead only unless a testing packet is opened. |

## Megatool Implication

The next "megatool" should be a cross-domain experiment router:

1. Gather captures candidate sources and source-body artifacts.
2. Source router demotes metadata-only rows into `domain_lead`, `adjacent_lead`, or `query_noise`.
3. Index selects repo/source context for the intended experiment.
4. Forum routes the packet to the best lane: proof, simulation, data, robotics, AI/ML, climate, materials, or publishing.
5. BuildLang/buildc eventually executes typed scientific kernels and emits compiler/runtime receipts.
6. Crucible checks claims against measurements and returns `MATCH`, `DRIFT`, or `UNVERIFIABLE`.
7. Learn turns the packet into a study receipt so the operator can internalize the domain method without confusing a lesson with a result.
8. Telos joins the receipts into public, academic, and parallel-Codex handoff packages.

## Immediate Experiments

| Experiment | Why now | Acceptance gate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Formal replay micro-packet | It is the closest path from source lead to actual proof. | A small Lean or theorem-prover example replays locally, or the packet remains `UNVERIFIABLE` with blocker reasons. |
| Climate uncertainty packet | Public climate claims are high-impact and easy to overclaim. | A source-body extraction identifies data source, model version, forecast horizon, uncertainty statement, and non-claim boundary. |
| Quantum scheduling toy model | Quantum network papers naturally map to graph/constraint receipts. | A tiny graph feasibility check runs with explicit assumptions; no hardware claim. |
| Materials benchmark packet | Materials discovery claims often mix benchmark, simulation, and wet-lab language. | One source-body review separates benchmark evidence from physical-material discovery. |
| Brain/AI convergence boundary packet | This lane is conceptually rich and overclaim-prone. | Claims are classified as computational analogy, empirical neuroscience, benchmark result, or philosophy. |

## Do Not Claim

- Do not claim Telos has solved a quantum, climate, materials, neuroscience, or formal-math frontier problem.
- Do not claim arXiv metadata proves paper truth.
- Do not claim source leads are latest or exhaustive literature coverage.
- Do not claim a proof assistant paper is replayed unless the proof actually replays locally.
- Do not claim materials discovery without benchmark/source-body review and, where relevant, wet-lab evidence.
- Do not claim climate validation without model/data/version/uncertainty receipts.
- Do not claim brain/AI convergence as neuroscience truth without empirical evidence.
