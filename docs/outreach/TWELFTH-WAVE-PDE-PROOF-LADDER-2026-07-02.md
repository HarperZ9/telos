# Twelfth-Wave PDE Proof-Packet Ladder

Date: 2026-07-02

Purpose: turn the eleventh-wave Navier-Stokes target into a deeper publication lane. This pass adds a second bounded Navier-Stokes subclaim packet, binds it to Crucible, connects it to BuildLang/buildc's shipped scientific-runtime receipt surface, and prepares outreach material that is useful without overstating what has been proved.

## Decision

Continue with Navier-Stokes existence and smoothness as the primary grand target, but publish only the proof ladder:

1. official problem statement and source anchors
2. smooth-periodic PDE identities
3. deterministic finite-mode witnesses
4. runtime scientific receipts
5. theorem-prover replay targets
6. public and official-copy papers with explicit evidence states

The grand problem remains `UNVERIFIABLE`.

## Current Tool Shape

| Tool layer | Current evidence | Status | Boundary |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Telos MCP/catalog | `telos.operator.doctor` reports `MATCH`; tool count 70, Telos tool count 37; `telos.mcp.freshness` reports expected versions for Gather 1.5.0, Index 2.8.0, Forum 1.12.0, Crucible 1.1.0, Telos 0.1.0. | `MATCH` | This is operator-surface readiness, not proof of scientific claims. |
| Gather | `gather.doctor` reports 1.5.0 `MATCH`; two arXiv searches retained 12 metadata rows total with 0 dropped. | `SOURCE_LEAD_ONLY` | arXiv metadata is not source-body review and does not validate paper claims. |
| Index | `index.context.envelope` for `telos` returned `MATCH`, graph pack `14515e573c240295bdc55756746b4e1c9b644968699e9c870cff5e5af4c5ea11`. | `MATCH` | Context envelope proves bounded workspace source references, not complete architecture truth. |
| Forum | Twelfth-wave prompt routed to `project-telos`, confidence `0.5`, no escalation. | `ROUTE_MATCH` | Confidence is routing confidence only. |
| Crucible | New skew-symmetry packet assessed 3 claims: 3 `MATCH`, 0 `DRIFT`, 0 `UNVERIFIABLE`; assessment seal `4b51ecd5703231b5e80f566d2d41a5780b09447e38b1a348cc4f310e26fb31c8`. | `CRUCIBLE_MATCH` | Applies to bounded subclaim packet only. |
| Learn | Learn 1.5.0 status/doctor reports `MATCH`; prooflesson will bind the twelfth-wave package after docs stabilize. | `MATCH` | Learn prooflessons preserve packet verdicts; they do not prove parent claims. |
| BuildLang/buildc | `buildc` 1.0.6, language 1.0.0; `buildc doctor` reports practical C-backend examples ready; heat-equation scientific receipt verifies with `status: match`, `receipt_status: PASS`, `violation_count: 0`, seal `e05d80773f8cc0400ff37abed44290e978dab1aec224760bc969c91932c5473e`. | `RUNTIME_RECEIPT_PASS` | The receipt proves observed series monotonicity for that program, not PDE correctness or a law of physics. Cargo emitted a dead-code warning, so do not claim warning-clean. |

## New Proof Packet

Packet: `docs/research/proof-packets/navier-stokes-periodic-skew-symmetry-v0/`

Subclaim:

> For a smooth divergence-free velocity field on a periodic two-dimensional domain, the incompressible Navier-Stokes advection term has zero direct kinetic-energy contribution: `integral u dot ((u dot grad)u) dx = 0`.

Executable witness:

- deterministic finite Fourier-mode streamfunction
- analytic velocity `u = (partial_y psi, -partial_x psi)`
- analytic derivatives evaluated on a `256 x 256` periodic grid
- nonlinear energy transfer checked against tolerance `1e-10`
- divergence checked against tolerance `1e-12`

Run result:

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `bounded_skew_symmetry_probe` | `MATCH` |
| `parent_millennium_problem` | `UNVERIFIABLE` |
| `nonlinear_energy_transfer_abs` | `7.792811534956812e-14` |
| `max_divergence_abs` | `0` |
| Crucible result | 3 `MATCH`, 0 `DRIFT`, 0 `UNVERIFIABLE` |
| Crucible assessment seal | `4b51ecd5703231b5e80f566d2d41a5780b09447e38b1a348cc4f310e26fb31c8` |

This is stronger than the previous Taylor-Green identity because it targets the nonlinear advection energy-transfer term with a finite-mode divergence-free field. It is still a bounded proof-packet seed, not a global regularity proof.

## PDE Ladder

| Layer | Evidence object | Current state | Next advancement |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Problem anchor | Clay Navier-Stokes and Millennium pages | `SOURCE_LEAD`; official status anchor says unsolved | Source-body statement card with exact problem formulation. |
| Smooth-periodic identity | Taylor-Green energy identity packet | `CRUCIBLE_MATCH` for one smooth periodic field | Add theorem-prover replay for the identity. |
| Nonlinear skew-symmetry | New finite-mode packet | `CRUCIBLE_MATCH` for one deterministic finite-mode witness | Formalize the integration-by-parts proof and replay in Lean/Coq. |
| Runtime scientific receipt | buildc heat-equation energy monotonicity receipt | `PASS` for observed monotone energy series | Implement a BuildLang Navier-Stokes skew-symmetry or vorticity-energy witness. |
| Source frontier | arXiv metadata intake | `SOURCE_LEAD_ONLY`, mixed relevance | Demote/review body text before citation. |
| Publication | PDE proof-packet ladder paper | draft in this pass | Add proof assistant appendix and reproducibility bundle. |

## Market/Research Wedge

The market wedge is not "we solved Navier-Stokes." The wedge is:

> proof-carrying scientific research packets that preserve the distinction between official source anchors, bounded executable witnesses, runtime receipts, proof-assistant replay, and parent-problem non-resolution.

This is valuable because many research automation systems collapse these layers into narrative confidence. Telos can make the evidence ladder visible, reproducible, and teachable.

## Immediate Gaps

- No theorem-prover replay exists yet for the skew-symmetry derivation.
- No BuildLang Navier-Stokes parity kernel exists yet; current BuildLang evidence is the heat-equation scientific-runtime receipt.
- arXiv rows are metadata only and include likely noise or unreviewed grand-claim titles.
- The current packet is 2D smooth periodic and finite-mode; it says nothing about arbitrary 3D weak/strong solutions.
- The buildc run is functional but not warning-clean in this invocation.

## Thirty-Day Push

1. Formalize the periodic skew-symmetry identity in a proof assistant.
2. Add a BuildLang/buildc finite-mode Navier-Stokes witness that emits a scientific-runtime receipt.
3. Add negative fixtures: non-divergence-free field, non-periodic boundary, and weakened tolerance.
4. Produce public website copy for the PDE proof-packet ladder.
5. Produce official-copy PDF/LaTeX with a claims table, receipt appendix, and no solved-problem language.
6. Ask an external PDE/formal-methods reviewer for a scoped review of the identity and proof ladder.

## Do Not Claim

- Do not claim Project Telos solved Navier-Stokes.
- Do not claim a finite-mode witness proves global regularity.
- Do not claim arXiv metadata validates any result.
- Do not claim a BuildLang runtime receipt proves PDE correctness.
- Do not claim the packet discovers a new physical law.
- Do not claim buildc is warning-clean from this pass.
